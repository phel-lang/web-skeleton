# Phel Web Skeleton

[Phel](https://phel-lang.org/) is a functional programming language that compiles to PHP. 

This repository provides you the basic setup to start coding a website using phel.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Phel requires at least PHP 8.3 and Composer.

#### Locally (no Docker)

1. Ensure you have PHP >=8.3 (Some help about how to install multiple PHP versions locally on [linux](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew) and [Mac](https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php))
1. Ensure you have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/composer-stable.phar)
1. Clone this repo
1. Install the dependencies | `composer install` 

#### Using Docker

1. Clone this repo
1. Build the image | `docker-compose up -d --build`
1. Go inside the console | `docker exec -ti -u dev phel_web_skeleton bash`
1. Install the dependencies | `composer install`

### Phel code

1. Write your phel code in `src/`
2. Run your web server with 
   - `composer run:dev`: it will recompile the code on every request
   - `composer run:prod`: it will run the same compiled code on every request 

### Tests

1. Write your phel tests in `tests/`
1. Execute your tests with `composer test`
